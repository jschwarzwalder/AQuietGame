Remove Controller Description.

The walls and door text-to-voice envelopes when you're near the door and never been near the walls.

The text-to-voice info (walls, door, keycard) repeats in every room — it should be only on a first encounter.

 AI repeats herself about the door when you’re still near it, AI repeats controls in the second room, when you skip them in the first.
